# Course recommender


This study comprises a recommender system for postgraduate courses based on soft skills.

There are 5 Python files:


1. read_functions.py is a file that consists on multiple methods that are used to read and process the data for the recommendations.
2. combinatorics_brute_force.py is used to check each and every one of the combinations of the courses, and update a file every 2000 tested combinations.
2. script_test.py is the script for the various tests, which helped us empirically tune the hyperparameters of the Genetic Algorithms.
3. script_rec_function.py is the script which executes the genetic algorithms based on hyperparameters that need to be set either on console or through a bash script.
4. script_analysis.py is the script that reads and analyses the results in order to write the summary result files.
